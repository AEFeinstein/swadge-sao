# Swadge SAO

These are [Simple Add-ons (SAO)](https://hackaday.io/project/52950-shitty-add-ons/log/159806-introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v169bis-standard) of Swadges ([MAGFest's](https://www.magfest.org/) swag badges). They are meant to decorate full size Swadges, but can be used on any badge with a SAO connector.

These [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) projects can be manufactured and assembled by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), though any PCB manufacturer should be capable. The parts used already have [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/) numbers and the projects can be easily exported using [Fabrication ToolKit](https://github.com/bennymeg/JLC-Plugin-for-KiCad). The projects are designed to be fabricated using [JLCPCB's "Economic PCB Assembly"](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/pcb-assembly-capabilities), which means:
* Two layers
* Board size between 10x10mm - 570x470mm
* 0402 minimum package size
* Single sided part placement (SMT/Thru-hole)
* No Gold Fingers, castellated Holes, or edge Plating

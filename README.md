# Swadge SAO

These are [Simple Add-ons (SAO)](https://hackaday.io/project/52950-shitty-add-ons/log/159806-introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v169bis-standard) of Swadges ([MAGFest's](https://www.magfest.org/) swag badges). They are meant to decorate full size Swadges, but can be used on any badge with a SAO connector.

These [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) projects can be manufactured and assembled by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), though any PCB manufacturer should be capable. The parts used already have [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/) numbers and the projects can be easily exported using [Fabrication ToolKit](https://github.com/bennymeg/JLC-Plugin-for-KiCad). The projects are designed to be fabricated using [JLCPCB's "Economic PCB Assembly"](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/pcb-assembly-capabilities), which means:
* Two layers
* Board size between 10x10mm - 570x470mm
* 0402 minimum package size
* Single sided part placement (SMT/Thru-hole)
* No Gold Fingers, castellated Holes, or edge Plating
* Order in QTY 30 or 50, depending on color

It is also recommended to manually [add tooling holes](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/47-How-to-add-tooling-holes-for-PCB-assembly-order). If you don't, then JLCPCB's engineers will add the holes themselves and validate their placement with you before manufacturing. The requirements are:

1. Two or three tooling holes should be added on the PCB, they should be placed in opposite corners of the PCB and as far apart from one another as practical.
1. Tooling holes should be 1.152mm(45.4mil) round non-plated holes with 0.148mm solder mask expansion.
    > A `tooling_hole` footprint is provided in the `sao` footprint library.
1. Tooling holes are only required for PCB assembly orders.
1. Please try to add tooling holes on empty space and keep them away from traces. If there is no enough room, you can add them to the copper area.

## Making a SAO From the Template

The SAO template has everything you need to create a SAO with the standard connector and eight tiny RGB LEDs which mirror the LEDs on the main Swadge.

1. Install the prerequisites:
    1. [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/download/), the CAD program used for circuit design
        * [Fabrication ToolKit Plugin](https://github.com/bennymeg/Fabrication-Toolkit)
    1. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/release/), the vector drawing program used for art
    1. [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), for version control
    1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), necessary for:
    1. svg2mod, a Python package to convert SVGs to KiCad modules, with the following command:
        ```bash
        python -m pip install svg2mod
        ```
1. Copy the template [art/sao_template.svg](art/sao_template.svg) and rename it for your SAO
1. Draw your SAO in Inkscape. If you're unfamiliar with PCB art, [here's a good guide about it](https://blog.wokwi.com/a-practical-guide-to-designing-pcb-art/). Don't get too hung up about the method there, it's old. Remember when drawing in the SVG that:
    * The `Edge.Cuts` layer is the outline of the board.
    * Layers that start with `F` are for the front and `B` are for the back.
    * `SilkS` layers are where silkscreen will be printed
    * `Cu` layers are where copper will be plated
    * `Mask` layers are where the solder mask will be **removed**. If you want to have exposed copper, draw the same shape on both the `Cu` and `Mask` layer!
    * `Dwgs.User` isn't used for fabrication, but you can put indicators there for where to place LEDs or any other "notes to self"
1. Convert your SVG to a `.kicad_mod` footprint file with this command. Make sure to replace the filename with your own!
    ```bash
    svg2mod --format latest -c -p 0.5 .\YOUR_SAO.svg
    ```
1. Move your `.kicad_mod` to the [sao.pretty/](sao.pretty/) folder
1. Copy [sao_template.kicad_pro](sao_template.kicad_pro) and [sao_template.kicad_sch](sao_template.kicad_sch) and rename them both for your SAO
1. Either in your favorite text editor or with `sed`, replace `sao_template` with your SAO's name in those two files
    ```bash
    sed -i 's/sao_template/YOUR_SAO/g' YOUR_SAO.kicad_pro YOUR_SAO.kicad_sch
    ```
1. Open YOUR_SAO.kicad_pro in KiCad
1. Open the PCB Editor. It will ask if you want to create the PCB file, and you should. It'll be empty.
1. Add your art by clicking `A`, selecting you footprint generated by svg2mod, and clicking on the page
1. Import the parts with `F8`
1. Place, route, and design rule check the parts. 
1. Export the project using the Fabrication ToolKit (the last button on the top toolbar)
1. Order your SAO from JLCPCB

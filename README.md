# Swadge SAO

These are [Simple Add-ons (SAO)](https://hackaday.io/project/52950-shitty-add-ons/log/159806-introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v169bis-standard) of Swadges ([MAGFest's](https://www.magfest.org/) swag badges). They are meant to decorate full size Swadges, but can be used on any badge with a SAO connector.

These [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) projects can be manufactured and assembled by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/). The parts used already have [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/) numbers and the projects can be easily exported using [Fabrication ToolKit](https://github.com/bennymeg/JLC-Plugin-for-KiCad).
